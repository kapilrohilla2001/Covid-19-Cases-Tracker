# Covid-19-Cases-Tracker
This tool enables real-time tracking of global COVID-19 cases, providing data by country and supporting downloads in various formats.

The COVID-19 Cases Tracker application is a Python based program which is used to Track the new cases that are occurring in the world due to COVID-19. The application is created with the help of `tkinter` module in the GUI and includes other libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `plyer`, and `pandas` to gather the current COVID-19 statistics from the Worldometer site. This data consists of total cases, new cases, total deaths, which are arranged in the structured format using the `pandas DataFrames`.
The application offers several key functionalities: it enables the user to type a certain country they want the application to notify them of specific events and changes via the `plyer`. Further, the COVID-19 data can be downloaded and saved in HTML, JSON, or CSV format as per the user convenience and for any further evaluations and reporting.
From the educational perspective, the project is a useful example of web scraping, data manipulation, and GUI in Python.In this manner, it assists business, academic, and individual needs and help make informed decisions based on timely and accurate information displayed in easily understandable formats.
In general, COVID-19 Cases Tracker highlights the use of Python to cope with timely data, interact with users through graphical interfaces, as well as respond to modern global issues like COVID-19. It will also serve as a reference manual for those who wish to pursue programming for data analysis in areas of health and beyond, as well as the curriculum for those engaging in the use of programming for data analysis in real-time.
